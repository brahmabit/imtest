Many edge case have not been handled. ( would love to discusss them)

Task 1 - completed \
Task 2 - completed \
task 2(i) - I would prefea process manager like forever anyday but for the time being i have used childe process to restart the server. \
Task 2(ii) - completed. have used a library that i generally use for scheduling but can be completed using node cron as well using the approach that was provided. The underlying priciple of the librry used is the same. \
